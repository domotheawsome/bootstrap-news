This is my final project for CS 494: Advanced Web Development. It is a full news app, pulling data from the OpenNews API, onto a beautifully styled app using Bootstrap. There is also a proxy server set up to scrape the article content from the site, using Express, Readability, and Node. 

I deeply enjoyed creating this project (and the course!) and will occasionally continue work on it as I see fit.
